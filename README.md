# Skillship-Internship-Data-science-projects
Utilized this lockdown to do something productive. SkillShip foundation provided and internship opportunity and here's the outcome. 
These are the few projects made by me in these past 2 months.
They include many regression and classification problems. 
## No-show appointments
It is an analysis of prediction of whether a patient shows up for his appointment or not. Various factors such as days of the week, age, health etc are considered.
## Placement and Salary analysis
It is a unique dataset where we predict if a student is placed or not and if yes then what is the approximate salary offered.
It is a combination of both regression and classification problem.
## Capstone Project
For my capstone project is chose Tic-Tac-Toe dataset available on Kaggle.
The aim is to build a model to predict if a tic tac toe game is won or lost or is a draw.
Head over to the notebooks of each of them to learn more.
